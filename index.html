		<h2 class="research-title"> <i> Internet Infrastructure </i> </h2>
		
		<p class="research"> The internet infrastructure connects different
		devices and systems across the world. It consists of physical components such as
		cables, routers, servers, and satellites, as well as protocols that define how data
		is transmitted and routed. The internet is not owned or controlled by any single entity,
		but rather by a decentralized system of organizations and authorities that cooperate to maintain its functionality.
		
		<h2 class="research-title"> <i> History of the Web </i> </h2>
		
		<p class="research"> The web is a service that runs on top of the internet infrastructure and allows users to access and share hyperlinked documents using a browser and a server. The web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, in 1989 at CERN, a European research organization. He wanted to create a universal linked information system that would enable scientists to collaborate and exchange data across different networks. He developed the HTTP, the HTML, and the first web browser and web server to make his vision possible. He also created the first web site in 1990 ( <a href="http://info.cern.ch"> First Website </a> ), which explained the basics of the web. He later founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1994, which is an international organization that sets standards and guidelines for the web.	</p>
		
		<h2 class="research-title"> <i> Internet Statistics: Middle East and Lebanon </i> </h2>
		<p class="research"> The World Bank reports that in 2019, 78.2% of Lebanese people were online. This is more than the regional average of 67.2% for the Middle East and North Africa. But the online population in Lebanon shrank by 0.6% from 2020 to 2021, maybe because of the economic and political turmoil. The internet speed in Lebanon is also very slow compared to other countries. The typical mobile internet speed was 21.3 Mbps and the typical fixed internet speed was 7.32 Mbps as of January 2022.
		When we look at how Lebanon compares with other countries in the Middle East and North Africa region, we can see that Lebanon is 8th out of 20 countries in how many people use the internet, but it is 18th out of 20 countries in how fast the mobile internet is and 19th out of 20 countries in how fast the fixed internet is.
